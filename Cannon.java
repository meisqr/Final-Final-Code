/**
Cannon class extends the "GameObject" class and represents a cannon object in a game. 
The constructor initializes the cannon object with an x-coordinate, a y-coordinate, and an object type. 
The class has a tileY property, an initHitbox method for setting the hitbox properties of the object, an 
update method, and a getter method for the tileY property. The update method checks if the object needs 
animation and updates the animation tick.
